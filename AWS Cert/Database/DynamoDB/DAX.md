> **DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)** is a fully managed, in-memory caching service for DynamoDB that improves read performance by reducing response times from milliseconds to microseconds, making it ideal for applications that require extremely fast read access. Itâ€™s useful because it seamlessly integrates with DynamoDB, offloading read-heavy workloads and reducing the load on your database.

- $ Microsecond latency for cached reads & queries
- $! No change to application logic
- ! 5 minute [[TTL (Time to Live)]] for cache by default
- ~ Up to 10 nodes in the cluster
- ! Allows for Multi-AZ (3 nodes minimum recommended)
- $ Very secure

# Versus ElastiCache
- ElastiCache used to store Aggregation Results
- DAX to store individual objects and query/scan cache

| **Feature**                         | **DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)**                                 | **[[ElastiCache]] for DynamoDB**                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Use Case**                | Caching for DynamoDB to accelerate read-heavy workloads        | General-purpose caching for various databases, including DynamoDB                  |
| **Integration**                     | Purpose-built for DynamoDB, no code changes needed for queries | Requires custom implementation to connect with DynamoDB                            |
| **Read Performance**                | Microsecond latency for cached reads                           | Microsecond to millisecond latency depending on configuration                      |
| **Write Performance**               | Pass-through for writes; no write caching                      | Can cache writes but typically used for read caching; requires manual invalidation |
| **Complexity**                      | Simple setup, tightly integrated with DynamoDB                 | Requires more complex setup and management                                         |
| **Cost Efficiency**                 | Designed to minimize DynamoDB read costs through caching       | Can be cost-effective but requires more tuning and management overhead             |
| **Automatic Failover**              | Yes, built-in for high availability                            | Yes, available with Redis and Memcached clusters                                   |
| **Consistency**                     | Eventually consistent reads from cache                         | Requires manual management of cache invalidation for consistency                   |
| **Supported Data Types**            | Only for DynamoDB table data                                   | General-purpose caching for various data stores (Redis/Memcached)                  |
| **Use with Non-DynamoDB Workloads** | No, DAX is DynamoDB-specific                                   | Yes, supports caching for multiple database types and use cases                    |
